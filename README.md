# dual.encryption

These are two examples of encryption/descryption. The first file is a single layer of encryption, easier to decode. The second file introduces a second layer, adding a layer of security. It also is impossible to fully decrypt using just the first file, requiring the encrypted string to be passed through the second file untouched.
